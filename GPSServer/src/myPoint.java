 * This is a spatio-temporal similarity search framework, coined SmartTrace.
 *Our framework can be utilized to promptly answer queries
 *of the form: “Report the objects (i.e., trajectories) that follow
 *a similar spatio-temporal motion to Q, where Q is some query
 *trajectory.” SmartTrace, relies on an in-situ data storage model,
 *where spatio-temporal data remains on the smartphone that
 *generated the given data, as well a state-of-the-art top-K query
 *processing algorithm, which exploits distributed trajectory similarity
 *measures in order to identify the correct answer promptly.
