SmartTrace
==========

This is a spatio-temporal similarity search framework, coined SmartTrace. Our framework can be utilized to promptly answer queries of the form: “Report the objects (i.e., trajectories) that follow a similar spatio-temporal motion to Q, where Q is some query trajectory.” SmartTrace, relies on an in-situ data storage model, where spatio-temporal data remains on the smartphone that generated the given data, as well a state-of-the-art top-K query processing algorithm, which exploits distributed trajectory similarity measures in order to identify the correct answer promptly.
